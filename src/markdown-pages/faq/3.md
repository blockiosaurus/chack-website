After projects are submitted, they will be evaluated by a panel of judges consisting of ecosystem builders and thought leaders. Winners will be selected based on a variety of factors including creative use of the Metaplex Protocol and compressed NFTs, the quality of the product, impact on the broader Solana ecosystem, and potential business viability. Winners of the event will be announced within a month of the hackathon submission deadline.
