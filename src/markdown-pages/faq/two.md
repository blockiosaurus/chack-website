Submissions will only be judged on the code and work produced between the start and end dates of cHack. Teams may submit projects that include pre-existing code developed up to two months prior to the beginning of the hackathon, but should disclose this in their submission. If, upon review, a project team is found to have completed substantial work before 2 months prior to the hackathon without disclosure, Metaplex retains the sole right to disqualify the project from the competition, ban the team from participating in future Metaplex hackathons, and/or revoke prizes if applicable.
