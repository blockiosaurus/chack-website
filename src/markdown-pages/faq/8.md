Participants are encouraged to visit the cHack channel within the [Metaplex Discord](https://t.co/kmuwlPVz0S) for technical assistance. There will also be webinars throughout the month of February. Additionally, Metaplex will be sponsoring a compression-focused week at MtnDAO from February 12th-16th where there will be workshops and office hours for those hacking in-person.
