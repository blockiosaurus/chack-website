## RWAs

In the Real-World Assets (RWA) track, we bridge the tangible with the digital. Participants are tasked with creating solutions that tokenize physical assets as NFTs on Solana, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient way to buy, sell, or trade real-world items. Whether it's art, real estate, collectibles, or beyond, your challenge is to solve the complexities of asset verification, ownership transfer, and legal compliance, transforming how we interact with real-world assets through blockchain technology.
